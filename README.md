# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 🎄

[![Advent of Code 2025 Banner](banner.png)](https://adventofcode.com/2025)

This repository tracks my solutions for the **[Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)** programming challenges.

## 🐍 Solutions & Structure

All solutions are implemented in **Python**.

Each day's solution is contained within its own folder (`day01`, `day02`, etc.) and includes the solution script (`solution.py`).

---

**⚠️ Important Note on Compliance:**
To adhere to the Advent of Code rules, **puzzle inputs and original problem descriptions are NOT included** in this repository. You must use your personal input downloaded from the AoC website and place it as `input.txt` within the relevant day's folder to run the solution.

---

## 🏃 Getting Started

To run any solution, navigate to the specific day's folder and execute the Python script:

```bash
cd day01
python solution.py
```

Happy holidays and happy coding!
